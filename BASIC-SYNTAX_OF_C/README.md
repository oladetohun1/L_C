# I would be learning c from the basics to Advance on  Here

## Description of Each Files

# This is my very first c- program,it feels so cool to write it--[A_simple_c_program.c](./A_simple_c_program.c)
<h3>This program contains the following</h3>
- The first lline starts with a combination of slash and asterisk, <i>/*</i>) and ends with <i>*/</i> ,this symbols are kknown as opening comment marks and closing comment marks.That means it is completely ignored by the compiler. The important of comment is to document what the code is about so that other programmers or anyone reading it can understand.

- The second line has what we call the <i>#Include directive</i> .This directives tell the C preprocessor to look for a file and place the content of that file in the location where the <i>#Include Directives is</i>.In our case the #Include directives ask for the preprocessor to look for and place the stdio.h at the location of the directives in the C program.

- The second line also contains the <b>Angle brackets<i>< ></i>and Double Quotes<i>" "</i></b> the angle brackets are used to tell the preprocessor to look for the header file in a directory ther thanthe current one whle the double quotes tells the preproccessor to look for the header files in the current directory.

- THe main() function : This is a very important functon ,every c progrma must have a main() function. Even if you creae another function in your program the main() Function would still executes first,it always does. A program end when all the statements in the main() Function have been executed

- The Newline character <span>(\n)</span>
The newline character tells the computer to move the cursor to the beginning of the next line

- The return statement :  All functions in C can return Values. For instance the main() function itself returns an integer value.

- The exit() Function : THe exit() Function can be used to end a program
